# About

The Statistical Python project was launched with support from a [grant from the NSF](https://nsf.elsevierpure.com/en/projects/pose-phase-1-an-open-source-ecosystem-for-statistical-python), titled _"POSE: Phase I: An open-source ecosystem for statistical Python."_

Our aim is to help:

- **Educators** teach statistics using a comprehensive, free computational ecosystem with clear user interfaces and accessible learning materials.
- **Researchers** produce reliable results through an extensive collection of well-engineered and tested computational libraries, featuring intuitive APIs and comprehensive documentation.
- **Method developers** share their innovations easily with a wide audience through standardized packaging and distribution channels.
- **Practicing statisticians and data scientists** access powerful tools to compute results efficiently, without the friction of switching between different software ecosystems.

We foster a sustainable ecosystem, aiming to attract statisticians who actively participate in developing the tools they use daily.

## Phase I

We have now completed Phase I, which focused on scoping activities to inform the transition into a sustainable open-source ecosystem.
During this phase, we conducted interviews with stakeholders across the statistical and scientific Python communities, engaged with related domain-specific OSEs to learn from their experiences, led group discussions at national and international conferences, and organized a workshop to gather input on community needs and technical priorities.

You may read our [2024 Landscape Analysis](2024-landscape), a primary output of the Phase I activities.

## Phase II

The above activities led to the development of a [Phase II proposal](static/Statistical-Python-POSE-Phase-II.pdf) to implement the formation of the Statistical Python Open Source Ecosystem.
