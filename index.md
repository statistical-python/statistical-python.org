# Welcome to Statistical Python

The Statistical Python project is a community-driven and community-owned initiative dedicated to building a robust, sustainable ecosystem for statistical software in Python.
Our mission is to unite statisticians, practitioners, educators, and developers to create high-quality, well-engineered statistical tools that empower research, education, and industry.
We foster collaboration and knowledge sharing to lower barriers to contribution, promote best practices in software engineering, and ensure that advanced statistical methods are accessible to the broader Python community.

As a domain stack within the larger [Scientific Python project](https://scientific-python.org/), Statistical Python leverages the strengths of the scientific Python ecosystem while addressing the unique needs of the statistical community.
Our vision is to connect statistical innovation with open-source software engineering, drawing on best practices from both the Python and R communities.
We aim to catalyze the growth of a vibrant, cross-disciplinary developer and user base, making Python a premier platform for statistical computing and education.
