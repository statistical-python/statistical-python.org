# 2024 Landscape Analysis

Python is widely adopted in data science, and its use for statistics is expanding rapidly---particularly in education and applied research.
The statistical ecosystem in Python is currently anchored by six major libraries:

- [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/), which provides fast, flexible array and numerical operations, and underpins nearly all statistical and scientific computing in Python.
  It supports descriptive statistics, correlation and covariance computations, random sampling, and tools for constructing histograms and binning data.
- [pandas](https://www.pandas.org/), which offers intuitive, high-performance data structures for tabular and time series data, making data cleaning, wrangling, reshaping, aggregation, and exploratory analysis straightforward and efficient.
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), which builds on NumPy to deliver a broad range of scientific and statistical functionality---including, in its [`scipy.stats`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html) submodule, a comprehensive suite of probability distributions, summary statistics, and basic statistical tests.
  It also provides modules for clustering, optimization, interpolation, and signal processing.
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), the foundational plotting library in Python, which enables the creation of high-quality static, animated, and interactive visualizations, and serves as the basis for many higher-level plotting and statistical graphics libraries.
- [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/), which offers tools for econometrics, classical statistics, and statistical modeling---including linear and generalized linear models, time series analysis, survival analysis, and hypothesis testing, with extensive support for model diagnostics and statistical inference.
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), which is best known for machine learning but also supports statistical modeling, offering a consistent API for regression, classification, clustering, model evaluation, statistical preprocessing, and dimensionality reduction.

These core libraries are generally well-tested, reliable, and uphold high software engineering standards, making them trusted foundations for research and application.
They benefit from contributions not only from science users but also from methods and software developers.
Libraries like scikit-learn are especially valued for their clean, consistent interfaces and their integration with the broader Python data stack, which streamlines workflows and enhances usability for both new and experienced users.

While there are many smaller, specialized packages available, the ecosystem remains dominated by these large, general-purpose libraries.
This concentration of resources ensures stability and quality but can also limit the visibility and adoption of innovative or niche statistical tools.
As Python's role in statistics continues to grow, fostering a more diverse and accessible ecosystem will be key to meeting the evolving needs of educators, researchers, and practitioners.
This will also require increased participation from statistics methods developers in the core packages.

# Relationship to Other Languages

R remains the gold standard for statistics, with better branding, a more cohesive ecosystem, and more teaching resources.
R's [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) provide a smoother and more cohesive user experience for statistics, and CRAN offers a vast repository of statistical packages.
The R ecosystem also benefits from substantial contributions from statistics methods developers.

:::

**Interoperability**: While some users switch between Python and R in their workflows, true interoperability is limited.
Most projects use one language at a time, though it is common to leverage R for data manipulation and Python for modeling, or vice versa.

**Other Platforms**: Tools like GraphPad Prism remain popular among practicing scientists for basic statistical analyses, indicating that neither Python nor R fully dominates all applied domains.

# Weaknesses and Needs

Despite Python's strengths, several challenges remain.

- **Fragmentation**: The ecosystem is fragmented, with major libraries (e.g., statsmodels vs. scikit-learn) adopting incompatible APIs and workflows, leading to confusion for users and students.
- **User Experience**: There is no central landing place or unified entry point for statistics in Python, unlike R's [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) or RStudio, making it harder for newcomers to get started.
- **Interoperability**: Data structures (such as those from [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)) do not always work seamlessly across libraries, requiring conversions and leading to unpredictable function outputs compared to R's tidyverse pipelines.
  Moreover some statistical methods use the results of other statistical subroutines (e.g., a multiple testing adjustment might be applied to the results of a number of different tests).
  At the moment there is limited support for putting statistical methods together as subroutines.
- **Teaching Resources**: Python lacks the abundance of user-friendly, statistics-focused tutorials and case studies found in the R community.
- **Contributor Barriers**: Contributing to core libraries can be difficult due to high standards and lack of modularity.
  Small, specialized packages exist but are less visible and less widely used than in R.
- **Statistical Methods Coverage**: Support for basic methods could be improved; moreover, Python's advanced or niche statistical methodology support generally falls behind R's vast [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) repository.
- **Comprehensive tooling for statistical analysis**: Data analysts using statistical methods need more than just the `p`-value for a statistical test or coefficient for a regression model.
  There are well-established numerical and visual diagnostics that accompany many statistical methods, but typically have limited support in existing packages.
  Moreover, analysts need to communicate their results through a variety of mediums and there is often minimal communication support built into Python statistical software.
- **Abstracting the core computation from the statistical methodology**: Many computations required in statistics (e.g. solving the optimization problem associated with a generalized linear model) have a variety of algorithmic options.
  While most statistical packages implement one (or a couple of) algorithms, there is rarely one "right" algorithm for every scenario.
  Depending on the size of the data, available hardware, analysis needs, etc., there can be multiple algorithms an analyst might want to use.
  Many Python statistical software packages tightly couple the core computation with the rest of the methodology, which makes it difficult to provide better computational approaches.
- **Community and Culture**: The Python statistics community is less cohesive and connected than R's, which benefits from a strong identity and established events.

# Conclusion

Python's statistics ecosystem is powerful but fragmented, with significant opportunities for improvement in usability, interoperability, teaching resources, and community cohesion.
While R remains the default for statistics, Python is gaining ground, especially as data science and machine learning continue to grow in influence.
Stronger integration, better documentation, and a more unified vision could help Python become a true peer to R in the statistics domain.
In particular, Python needs:

- A unified, user-friendly interface for statistics, possibly modeled after scikit-learn.
- Improved interoperability between core data structures and libraries.
- More accessible teaching resources and case studies focused on statistics.
- Lower barriers for contributors and greater visibility for specialized statistical packages.
- Stronger community identity and central organization for statistics in Python.

The Statistical Python project seeks to address these needs by fostering collaboration, sharing best practices, and building a sustainable, open community.
As a domain stack within the [Scientific Python project](https://scientific-python.org/), and with support from the NSF POSE Phase I grant, we are committed to making Python a premier platform for statistical computing, education, and research.
